# ML_Evaluating_Regression_Models

## The Big Question is, How do I select the Best Regression Model
_Based on your dataset, this repo explains how to select the best regression model for your Machine Learning_

## The r2_score is used to determine the best regression model
> The R² score, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical metric used to evaluate the performance of a regression model. It quantifies how well the model's predictions align with the actual data.

## Common Names for R² Score:
+ Coefficient of Determination (most formal name).
+ R-Squared (commonly used shorthand).
+ Goodness of Fit Measure (describes its purpose).

## Application of R² Score in the Multiple Linear Regression
